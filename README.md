# Ski Touring Map

This map consists of several layers quite useful for planning ski tours:

* The basemap is taken from https://outdooractive.com
* The pistes overlay from https://www.opensnowmap.org/
* The steepeness overlay from https://www.openslopemap.org/

The alpine huts and wilderness huts are retrieved from the OverPass API.
